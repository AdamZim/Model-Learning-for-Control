# Model Learning for Control

This repository explores the implementation of a neural network in model learning control. A basic neural network shall be constructed from scratch in plain Python. All algorithims shall be implemented from scratch without the addition of any machine learning libraries.

The goal is to train a neural network to model the phyiscal system describing a robotic arm.  The model will then be used in a feed-forward control system to compute the torque inputs to move the robot along a specified trajectory.

The robotic arm being modeled is a Proficio
